# BadMedicine.Dicom
The purpose of BadMedicine.Dicom is to generate large volumes of complex (in terms of tags) dicom images for integration/stress testing ETL and image management tools.

There are a number of public sources of Dicom clinical images e.g. [TCIA ](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/).  The difficulty with using these for integration/stress testing is that they often:

- Are anonymised (majority of tags have been removed)
- Do not represent the breadth of Modalities/Tags found in a live clinical [PACS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system).
- Take up a lot of space

BadMedicine.Dicom generates dicom images on demand based on an anonymous aggregate model of tag data found in scottish medical imaging.  It is an extension of [BadMedicine](https://github.com/HicServices/BadMedicine) which generates traditional EHR records.

# Tag Data

Basic random patient information (age, CHI etc) are generated by [BadMedicine](https://github.com/HicServices/BadMedicine)

The following tags are populated in dicom files generated:

|Tag | Model |
|-----|-----|
| PatientID | The CHI number of the (random) patient|
| PatientAge | |

# Pixel Data
Currently pixel data is written as a black square with the SOP Instance UID written in white.

# Outstanding Issues

- SeriesDate is always the same as Study Date (see `Seres` constructor), for secondary capture this should/could not be the case (we should look at how this corresponds in the PACS data we have)
